# Visual Studio Code

IMO, it's better than Sublime and Atom, so this is the only GUI editor (IDE) I'll be talking about.

## Installation

[Download link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) is all you need.

> On Linux, installing the .deb package will automatically install the apt repository and signing key to enable auto-updating.

## Remote Development

A new feature on VS Code Insiders.

It enables you to install certain extensions, edit and run codes on a remote machine, container, or WSL.
